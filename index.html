                <p>I am a college student at USC, and I want to eat
                    lunch quickly at the Russell House, but the lines are always too long,
                    and I donâ€™t know where to go to get food the fastest.

                <p>My group brainstormed many different ideas on how we could solve or work on the problems that came with our problem statement. We also thought of ideas that could make our app better for use.
